# ml_binary_classification_gridsearch_hyperOpt

This repository contains Python code for binary classification using grid search and hyperparameter optimization techniques.

## Overview

Binary classification is a common machine learning task where the goal is to categorize data into one of two classes. This repository provides a framework for performing binary classification using various machine learning algorithms and optimizing their hyperparameters through grid search and hyperparameter optimization techniques.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the code in this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
